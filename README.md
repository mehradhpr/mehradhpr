## Brought to you by coffee 

#### I am a developer, with a strong track record in software engineering and a great distinction CS graduate! 

As a strong believer of experiential learning. Therefore, I have dedicated this Github profile to showcase my projects that I have done to delve deep into a concept/technology/language.

- I have done extensive enterprise-level, profesisonal development using TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Express and Node.js
- I have a deep passion for machine learning, there is something very satisfying about seeing your model converge!
- I have experience with Python, Pytorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, and many more Python libraries for data science and deep learning.
- The greatest thing about being a developer, is the ability to solve problems and replicate the solution for others to use.
